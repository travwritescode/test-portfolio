# Travâ€™s Test Portfolio

This is a place for me to showcase my skills in test automation. I have created this repository to show my abilities in automating tests with the two technologies I have the most recent experience:

- JavaScript and Cypress.io
- Python and Selenium WebDriver/Requests

I am automating against publicly available test websites including the [Restful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) with Python and requests, and the [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) online shopping website.

These websites are in completed or mostly completed states so these automated test solutions represent an unchanging app state and will undergo very few updates and changes. Regardless, I have built them in a way to be extensible and maintainable.

This repository is also a work in progress. As I continue my job search, this is where I will be practicing to keep my skills up to date. To stay as up-to-date as possible with what I am practicing, I encourage you to check out my code log on my hosted [GitHub page](https://travwritescode.github.io/).
